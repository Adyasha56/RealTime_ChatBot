# Real-Time Chatbot

Welcome to the Real-Time Chatbot repository! This project leverages the capabilities of NLTK, PyTorch, and TensorFlow to create an advanced chatbot that can understand and respond to user input in real time. With its natural language processing and deep learning models, this chatbot is suitable for integration into various applications and platforms.

## Features
- Natural Language Processing: Utilizes NLTK for tokenization, stemming, and other NLP tasks.
- Deep Learning: Employs PyTorch and TensorFlow for training and deploying neural network models.
- Real-Time Interaction: Offers a seamless conversational experience with users.
- Customizable: Easily adaptable to different use cases and conversation domains.

## Repository Structure
- app.py: Main application file to run the chatbot.
- chat.py: Chat handling and response generation.
- model.py: Definition and loading of the neural network model.
- nltk_utils.py: Utility functions for natural language processing using NLTK.
- train.py: Training script for the neural network model.
- intents.json: JSON file containing conversation intents and training data.
- data.pth: Saved model data file.
